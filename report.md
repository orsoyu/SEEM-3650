## Task 3: Model Architecture Exploration

![Alt text](figures/layers_vs_loss.png "Layers vs Loss at 5000-th iteration")

### Validation loss for different configurations:

- 2 layers, 4 heads: Loss = 1.4958
- 3 layers, 4 heads: Loss = 1.4773
- 5 layers, 4 heads: Loss = 1.5592
- 7 layers, 4 heads: Loss = 1.7624

### Best Configuration:

- Number of layers: 3
- Number of heads: 4
- Lowest validation loss: 1.4773

## Task 4: Code Generation

Although the generated code demonstrates an understanding of structure, it contains numerous semantic flaws. Common issues include mismatches between function parameters and their usage within the function body, method calls that use incorrect or incompatible arguments, and function names that are nonsensicalâ€”such as "multi_margin_margin_margin_margin_label_margin." Additionally, the code often features incomplete or syntactically incorrect statements, further impacting its functionality and readability.
